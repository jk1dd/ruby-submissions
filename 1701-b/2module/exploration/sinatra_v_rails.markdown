## Sinatra versus Rails Exploration

### Setup:

First, clone down the Rails project:

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/turingschool/job-tracker.git rails_project
```

And then clone down the Sinatra project:

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share.git sinatra_project
```
Now cd into each project, run `bundle` on each project, and you're ready to go. We will only be looking at the code base and not interacting with the app. If you wanted to run the server and interact with the app, you would need to create your database, migrate your migrations, etc.

### Exercise:

1. Take a look at this stripped down Sinatra app and this stripped down Rails app. How are they different and how are they similar? Identify 5 differences, and for each one describe 1-2 implications. What effect does that difference have for each framework? If you don't know exactly, draw on your knowledge and experience and make some educated guesses/inferences. Also, practice your research skills to look into the differences.

>They are similar in X, but different in y.

>Differences:
>1. Item, implication, effect for framework
>2. Item
>3. Item
>4. Item
>5. Item

2. Consulting blogs and commentary you find online, identify 3 similarities between Rails and Sinatra.

>Similarities:
>1. First
>2. Second
>3. Third

3. Consulting blogs and commentary you find online, identify 3 things that distinguish Rails, advantages.

>Advantages:
>1. advantage
>2. advantage
>3. advantage

4. In your Rails project, what does the `routes.rb` file inside of the `/config` directory do? What does this correlate to in our Sinatra app?

>In the Rails project, the `routes.rb` in the `/config` does X. In the Sinatra app, this correlates to X.

5. We teach Sinatra by adding some structures that Sinatra doesn’t need, but help you make the transition between Sinatra and Rails. What does a stripped down implementation of Sinatra look like, and what are the pieces we’ve added for educational purposes?

>A stripped down Sinatra implementation looks like Z. So, the added pieces include A, B, C.
